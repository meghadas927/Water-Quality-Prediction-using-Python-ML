# Water-Quality-Prediction-using-Python-ML
Developed and deployed a predictive model to assess water  potability by analyzing critical factors such as pH, hardness,  solids, chloramines, sulfate, and   conductivity. The model accurately classified water safety with  a final accuracy of 0.58, aligning with the original KNN model.
